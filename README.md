# Magic-Sandbox

Do you have a messy htdocs folder? 
I did, so created this litle standalone php file to organize my htdocs in a grid view with a search box to make it easier to look up for those old projects.

### Features
 
 - Standalone -  just one file
 - plain javascript and php
 - Grid View of all folders on the same folder level
 - Search for folders
 - Responssive
 - Extra info - just add an info.txt on your project folder with a description of the project and will automatacly add it to the grid.
 
Feel free to send me your thoughs and features requests!

Note: You may need to turn off PHP warnings or remove the funtionalaty of adding extra info to the project list using the .txt file if you can only see a empty page.
